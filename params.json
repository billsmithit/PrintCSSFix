Not that having a responsive template is enough, or even making it look great on old Nokia Phones is enough work, now you can link printcssfix.css and all will be 'fixed'.\r\n\r\n**Take a look at what the fix does by print previewing the page (or print it if you want too!)**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://raw.github.com/billsmithit/PrintCSSFix/master/printfix.css\">\r\n```\r\nOR do the normal git thing:\r\n```\r\n$ https://github.com/billsmithit/PrintCSSFix.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeel free to contribute or tweet any further updates to @billsmithit\r\n\r\n### Designer Notes\r\nNo need to worry about the design, the PrintCSSFix analysis your design, in detail.
